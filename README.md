For team which will continue our work, plz note that:

1. Download 微信开发者工具

2. Download ***draft_version*** folder first. This file has combine basic components of management, reserve, payment, and realize the interface of login and database.

3. You can also browse other files like Login, Payment, index, etc. for the reference. However, Due to upload and naming issues, these files may not be able to be directly opened and displayed in 微信开发者工具.

4. Therefore, we *strongly recommend that you only download and import draft_ version* file to 微信开发者工具. When you open 微信开发者工具, select Import File, choose this folder, and then click on 使用测试号，不使用云服务 to test our initial model.

5. But this does not mean that other files are unimportant, on the contrary, they are crucial. For the backend database, you can find it in the **pages** folder and **barbershop_db.sql** file. For front-end code and components, they have basically been integrated into *draft_version* folder.

6. The **follow-up work** includes integrating the front and back ends, connecting functions with the database, achieving the login of customers, hairdressers, bosses, and three users, as well as the implementation of their respective functions (customers can manage their own appointments, choose hairdressers and services, as well as subsequent evaluations, hairdressers can receive appointments and evaluations, bosses can manage and modify hairdresser and product information, and so on), and optimizing the user experience.
